The purpose of the module is to reveal as many letters of a short story as many kilometers have been logged in the system. The result can be seen at https://gulyakor.hu/hu/node/2508 (unfortunately only in Hungarian). Here you can visualize each contributed kilometer by a colored letter corresponding to the runner. The coloring of runners can be toggled.
